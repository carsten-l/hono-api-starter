# hono-api-starter
a basic rest api built with hono.js. It uses SQLite as the database, and prisma as the ORM.

The api uses the Zod-Validator middleware for validating incoming data.

In the process of creating this i have explored different ways of organising the files in the repo. 
I have looked at other code, and consulted the hono docs for inspiration on code organization.

The api has a set of endpoints that can be used as a template for a REST API.
